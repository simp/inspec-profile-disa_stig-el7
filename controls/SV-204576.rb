    utilize an operating system. Limiting the number of allowed users and sessions per user is helpful in reducing the
    risks related to DoS attacks.
    This requirement addresses concurrent sessions for information system accounts and does not address concurrent
    sessions by single users via multiple system accounts. The maximum number of concurrent sessions should be defined
    based on mission needs and the operational environment for each system.'
