    Verifying the authenticity of the software prior to installation validates the integrity of the patch or upgrade
    received from a vendor. This verifies the software has not been tampered with and that it has been provided by a
    trusted vendor. Self-signed certificates are disallowed by this requirement. The operating system should not have to
    verify the software again. This requirement does not mandate DoD certificates for this purpose; however, the
    certificate used to verify the software must be from an approved CA.'
