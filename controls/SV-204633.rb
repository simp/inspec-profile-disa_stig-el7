  desc 'Using an authentication device, such as a CAC or token that is separate from the information system, ensures
    that even if the information system is compromised, that compromise will not affect credentials stored on the
    authentication device.
    Multifactor solutions that require devices separate from information systems gaining access include, for example,
    hardware tokens providing time-based or challenge-response authenticators and smart cards such as the U.S.
    Government Personal Identity Verification card and the DoD Common Access Card.
    A privileged account is defined as an information system account with authorizations of a privileged user.
    Remote access is access to DoD nonpublic information systems by an authorized user (or an information system)
    communicating through an external, non-organization-controlled network. Remote access methods include, for example,
    dial-up, broadband, and wireless.
    This requirement only applies to components where this is specific to the function of the device or has the concept
    of an organizational user (e.g., VPN, proxy capability). This does not apply to authentication for the purpose of
    configuring the device itself (management).'

  desc  'check', "
    Verify the operating system implements certificate status checking for PKI
authentication.

    Check to see if Online Certificate Status Protocol (OCSP) is enabled on the
system with the following command:

    # grep cert_policy /etc/pam_pkcs11/pam_pkcs11.conf | grep -v \"^#\"

    cert_policy = ca, ocsp_on, signature;
    cert_policy = ca, ocsp_on, signature;
    cert_policy = ca, ocsp_on, signature;

    There should be at least three lines returned.

    If \"ocsp_on\" is not present in all uncommented \"cert_policy\" lines in
\"/etc/pam_pkcs11/pam_pkcs11.conf\", this is a finding.
  "
  desc 'fix', "
    Configure the operating system to do certificate status checking for PKI
authentication.

    Modify all of the \"cert_policy\" lines in
\"/etc/pam_pkcs11/pam_pkcs11.conf\" to include \"ocsp_on\".
