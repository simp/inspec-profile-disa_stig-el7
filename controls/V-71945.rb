  title "If three unsuccessful root logon attempts within 15 minutes occur the
associated account must be locked."
  desc  "
    By limiting the number of failed logon attempts, the risk of unauthorized system
access via user password guessing, otherwise known as brute-forcing, is reduced.
Limits are imposed by locking the account.

    Satisfies: SRG-OS-000329-GPOS-00128, SRG-OS-000021-GPOS-0000.
