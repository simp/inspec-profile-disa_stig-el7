    The shorter the password, the lower the number of possible combinations that
need to be tested before the password is compromised.

    Password complexity, or strength, is a measure of the effectiveness of a
password in resisting attempts at guessing and brute-force attacks. Password length
is one factor of several that helps to determine strength and how long it takes to
crack a password. Use of more characters in a password helps to exponentially
increase the time and/or resources required to compromise the password.
