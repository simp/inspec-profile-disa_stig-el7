Check to see if the \"dracut-fips\" package is installed with the following
command:

# yum list installed | grep dracut-fips

dracut-fips-033-360.el7_2.x86_64.rpm

If a \"dracut-fips\" package is installed, check to see if the kernel command
line is configured to use FIPS mode with the following command:

Note: GRUB 2 reads its configuration from the \"/boot/grub2/grub.cfg\" file on
traditional BIOS-based machines and from the \"/boot/efi/EFI/redhat/grub.cfg\"
file on UEFI machines.

# grep fips /boot/grub2/grub.cfg
/vmlinuz-3.8.0-0.40.el7.x86_64 root=/dev/mapper/rhel-root ro rd.md=0 rd.dm=0
rd.lvm.lv=rhel/swap crashkernel=auto rd.luks=0 vconsole.keymap=us
rd.lvm.lv=rhel/root rhgb fips=1 quiet

If the kernel command line is configured to use FIPS mode, check to see if the
system is in FIPS mode with the following command:

# cat /proc/sys/crypto/fips_enabled
1

If a \"dracut-fips\" package is not installed, the kernel command line does not
have a fips entry, or the system has a value of \"0\" for \"fips_enabled\" in
\"/proc/sys/crypto\", this is a finding."
  desc "fix", "Configure the operating system to implement DoD-approved
encryption by installing the dracut-fips package.

To enable strict FIPS compliance, the fips=1 kernel option needs to be added to
the kernel command line during system installation so key generation is done
with FIPS-approved algorithms and continuous monitoring tests in place.

Configure the operating system to implement DoD-approved encryption by
following the steps below:

The fips=1 kernel option needs to be added to the kernel command line during
system installation so that key generation is done with FIPS-approved
algorithms and continuous monitoring tests in place. Users should also ensure
that the system has plenty of entropy during the installation process by moving
the mouse around, or if no mouse is available, ensuring that many keystrokes
are typed. The recommended amount of keystrokes is 256 and more. Less than 256
keystrokes may generate a non-unique key.

Install the dracut-fips package with the following command:

# yum install dracut-fips

Recreate the \"initramfs\" file with the following command:

Note: This command will overwrite the existing \"initramfs\" file.

# dracut -f

Modify the kernel command line of the current kernel in the \"grub.cfg\" file
by adding the following option to the GRUB_CMDLINE_LINUX key in the
\"/etc/default/grub\" file and then rebuild the \"grub.cfg\" file:

fips=1

Changes to \"/etc/default/grub\" require rebuilding the \"grub.cfg\" file as
follows:

On BIOS-based machines, use the following command:

# grub2-mkconfig -o /boot/grub2/grub.cfg

On UEFI-based machines, use the following command:

# grub2-mkconfig -o /boot/efi/EFI/redhat/grub.cfg

If /boot or /boot/efi reside on separate partitions, the kernel parameter
boot=<partition of /boot or /boot/efi> must be added to the kernel command
line. You can identify a partition by running the df /boot or df /boot/efi
command:

# df /boot
Filesystem 1K-blocks Used Available Use% Mounted on
/dev/sda1 495844 53780 416464 12% /boot

To ensure the boot= configuration option will work even if device naming
changes between boots, identify the universally unique identifier (UUID) of the
partition with the following command:

# blkid /dev/sda1
/dev/sda1: UUID=\"05c000f1-a213-759e-c7a2-f11b7424c797\" TYPE=\"ext4\"

For the example above, append the following string to the kernel command line:

boot=UUID=05c000f1-a213-759e-c7a2-f11b7424c797

Reboot the system for the changes to take effect.
