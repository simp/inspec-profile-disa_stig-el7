    A session lock is a temporary action taken when a user stops work and moves
away from the immediate physical vicinity of the information system but does
not want to log out because of the temporary nature of the absence.

    The session lock is implemented at the point where session activity can be
determined.

    The ability to enable/disable a session lock is given to the user by
default. Disabling the userâ€™s ability to disengage the graphical user interface
session lock provides the assurance that all sessions will lock after the
specified period of time.
