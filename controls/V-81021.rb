  title "The Red Hat Enterprise Linux operating system must label all off-loaded audit logs before sending them to the central log server."
  desc  "
   Information stored in one location is vulnerable to accidental or incidental deletion or alteration. 
   Off-loading is a common process in information systems with limited audit storage capacity. When audit 
   logs are not labeled before they are sent to a central log server, the audit data will not be able to 
   be analyzed and tied back to the correct system.

  Verify the audisp daemon is configured to label all off-loaded audit logs:

  # grep \"name_format\" /etc/audisp/audispd.conf

  name_format = hostname

  If the \"name_format\" option is not \"hostname\", \"fqd\", or \"numeric\", or the line is commented out, this is a finding.

  Edit the /etc/audisp/audispd.conf file and add or update the \"name_format\" option:

  name_format = hostname

  # service auditd restart
