  desc 'It is detrimental for operating systems to provide, or install by default, functionality exceeding
    requirements or mission objectives. These unnecessary capabilities or services are often overlooked and therefore
    may remain unsecured. They increase the risk to the platform by providing additional attack vectors.
    Operating systems are capable of providing a wide variety of functions and services. Some of the functions and
    services, provided by default, may not be necessary to support essential organizational operations (e.g., key
    missions, functions).
    The rsh-server service provides an unencrypted remote access service that does not provide for the confidentiality
    and integrity of user passwords or the remote session and has very weak authentication.
    If a privileged user were to log on using this service, the privileged user password could be compromised.'
