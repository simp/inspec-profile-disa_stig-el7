  title "All network connections associated with SSH traffic must terminate at
the end of the session or after 10 minutes of inactivity, except to fulfill
documented and validated mission requirements."
  desc  "
    Terminating an idle SSH session within a short time period reduces the
window of opportunity for unauthorized personnel to take control of a
management session enabled on the console or console port that has been left
unattended. In addition, quickly terminating an idle SSH session will also free
up resources committed by the managed network element.

    Terminating network connections associated with communications sessions
includes, for example, de-allocating associated TCP/IP address/port pairs at
the operating system level and de-allocating networking assignments at the
application level if multiple application sessions are using a single operating
system-level network connection. This does not mean that the operating system
terminates all sessions or network access; it only ends the inactive session
and releases the resources associated with that session.
