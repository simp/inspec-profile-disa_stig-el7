  title "The SSH daemon must not permit Kerberos authentication unless needed."
  desc  "Kerberos authentication for SSH is often implemented using Generic
Security Service Application Program Interface (GSSAPI). If Kerberos is enabled
through SSH, the SSH daemon provides a means of access to the system's Kerberos
implementation. Vulnerabilities in the system's Kerberos implementation may
then be subject to exploitation. To reduce the attack surface of the system,
the Kerberos authentication mechanism within SSH must be disabled for systems
not using this capability."
