    Password complexity, or strength, is a measure of the effectiveness of a password in resisting attempts at guessing
    and brute-force attacks. Password length is one factor of several that helps to determine strength and how long it
    takes to crack a password. Use of more characters in a password helps to exponentially increase the time and/or
