    altered. These hashes must be FIPS 140-2 approved cryptographic hashes.
    Red Hat Enterprise Linux operating system installation media ships with an optional file integrity tool called
    Advanced Intrusion Detection Environment (AIDE). AIDE is highly configurable at install time. This requirement
    assumes the "aide.conf" file is under the "/etc" directory.'

    validating file contents and directories.
    Check to see if AIDE is installed on the system with the following command:
    # yum list installed aide
    If AIDE is not installed, ask the System Administrator how file integrity checks are performed on the system.
    If there is no application installed to perform file integrity checks, this is a finding.
    Note: AIDE is highly configurable at install time. These commands assume the "aide.conf" file is under the "/etc"
    directory.
    Use the following command to determine if the file is in another location:
    # find / -name aide.conf
    Check the "aide.conf" file to determine if the "sha512" rule has been added to the rule list being applied to the
    files and directories selection lists. Exclude any log files, or files expected to change frequently, to reduce
    unnecessary notifications.
    An example rule that includes the "sha512" rule follows:
    All=p+i+n+u+g+s+m+S+sha512+acl+xattrs+selinux
    /bin All # apply the custom rule to the files in bin
    /sbin All # apply the same custom rule to the files in sbin
    If the "sha512" rule is not being used on all uncommented selection lines in the "/etc/aide.conf" file, or another
    file integrity tool is not using FIPS 140-2-approved cryptographic hashes for validating file contents and
    directories, this is a finding.'
