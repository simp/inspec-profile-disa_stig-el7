  title "The Standard Mandatory DoD Notice and Consent Banner must be displayed
immediately prior to, or as part of, remote access logon prompts."
  desc  "
    Display of a standardized and approved use notification before granting access
to the publicly accessible operating system ensures privacy and security
notification verbiage used is consistent with applicable federal laws, Executive
Orders, directives, policies, regulations, standards, and guidance.

    System use notifications are required only for access via logon interfaces with
human users and are not required when such human interfaces do not exist.

    The banner must be formatted in accordance with applicable DoD policy. Use the
following verbiage for operating systems that can accommodate banners of 1300
characters:

    \"You are accessing a U.S. Government (USG) Information System (IS) that is
provided for USG-authorized use only.

    By using this IS (which includes any device attached to this IS), you consent to
the following conditions:

    -The USG routinely intercepts and monitors communications on this IS for
purposes including, but not limited to, penetration testing, COMSEC monitoring,
network operations and defense, personnel misconduct (PM), law enforcement (LE), and
counterintelligence (CI) investigations.

    -At any time, the USG may inspect and seize data stored on this IS.

    -Communications using, or data stored on, this IS are not private, are subject
to routine monitoring, interception, and search, and may be disclosed or used for
any USG-authorized purpose.

    -This IS includes security measures (e.g., authentication and access controls)
to protect USG interests--not for your personal benefit or privacy.

    -Notwithstanding the above, using this IS does not constitute consent to PM, LE
or CI investigative searching or monitoring of the content of privileged
communications, or work product, related to personal representation or services by
attorneys, psychotherapists, or clergy, and their assistants. Such communications
and work product are private and confidential. See User Agreement for details.\"

displays the Standard Mandatory DoD Notice and Consent Banner before granting access
to the system.

Check for the location of the banner file being used with the following command:

# grep -i banner /etc/ssh/sshd_config

banner=/etc/issue

This command will return the banner keyword and the name of the file that contains
the ssh banner (in this case \"/etc/issue\").

If the line is commented out, this is a finding.

View the file specified by the banner keyword to check that it matches the text of
the Standard Mandatory DoD Notice and Consent Banner:

\"You are accessing a U.S. Government (USG) Information System (IS) that is provided

If the system does not display a graphical logon banner or the banner does not match
the Standard Mandatory DoD Notice and Consent Banner, this is a finding.

If the text in the file does not match the Standard Mandatory DoD Notice and Consent
Banner, this is a finding."
  tag "fix": "Configure the operating system to display the Standard Mandatory DoD
Notice and Consent Banner before granting access to the system via the ssh.

Edit the \"/etc/ssh/sshd_config\" file to uncomment the banner keyword and configure
it to point to a file that will contain the logon banner (this file may be named
differently or be in a different location if using a version of SSH that is provided
by a third-party vendor). An example configuration line is:

banner=/etc/issue

Either create the file containing the banner or replace the text in the file with
the Standard Mandatory DoD Notice and Consent Banner. The DoD required text is:

\"You are accessing a U.S. Government (USG) Information System (IS) that is provided
