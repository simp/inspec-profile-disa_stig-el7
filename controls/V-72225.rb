    Display of a standardized and approved use notification before granting
access to the publicly accessible operating system ensures privacy and security
notification verbiage used is consistent with applicable federal laws,
Executive Orders, directives, policies, regulations, standards, and guidance.

    System use notifications are required only for access via logon interfaces
with human users and are not required when such human interfaces do not exist.

    The banner must be formatted in accordance with applicable DoD policy. Use
the following verbiage for operating systems that can accommodate banners of
1300 characters:
