  desc 'Information stored in one location is vulnerable to accidental or incidental deletion or alteration.
    Off-loading is a common process in information systems with limited audit storage capacity.
    One method of off-loading audit logs in Red Hat Enterprise Linux is with the use of the audisp-remote dameon.  When
    audit logs are not labeled before they are sent to a central log server, the audit data will not be able to be
    analyzed and tied back to the correct system.'

    If the "name_format" option is not "hostname", "fqd", or "numeric", or the line is commented out, ask the System
    Administrator to indicate how the audit logs are off-loaded to a different system or storage media, and to indicate
    if the logs are labeled appropriately.
