If local host authentication is being used and the \"/etc/resolv.conf\" file is
not empty, this is a finding.

If the DNS entry is found on the hostâ€™s line of the \"/etc/nsswitch.conf\"
file, verify the operating system is configured to use two or more name servers
for DNS resolution.

Determine the name servers used by the system with the following command:

# grep nameserver /etc/resolv.conf
nameserver 192.168.1.2
nameserver 192.168.1.3

If less than two lines are returned that are not commented out, this is a
finding."
