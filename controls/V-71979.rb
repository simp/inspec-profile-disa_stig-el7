  title "The operating system must prevent the installation of software,
patches, service packs, device drivers, or operating system components of local
packages without verification they have been digitally signed using a
certificate that is issued by a Certificate Authority (CA) that is recognized
and approved by the organization."
  desc  "
    Changes to any software components can have significant effects on the
overall security of the operating system. This requirement ensures the software
has not been tampered with and that it has been provided by a trusted vendor.

    Accordingly, patches, service packs, device drivers, or operating system
components must be signed with a certificate recognized and approved by the
organization.

    Verifying the authenticity of the software prior to installation validates
the integrity of the patch or upgrade received from a vendor. This verifies the
software has not been tampered with and that it has been provided by a trusted
vendor. Self-signed certificates are disallowed by this requirement. The
operating system should not have to verify the software again. This requirement
does not mandate DoD certificates for this purpose; however, the certificate
used to verify the software must be from an approved CA.
