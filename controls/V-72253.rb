Note: If RHEL-07-021350 is a finding, this is automatically a finding as the system
cannot implement FIPS 140-2-approved cryptographic algorithms and hashes.

Check that the SSH daemon is configured to only use MACs employing FIPS
140-2-approved ciphers with the following command:

# grep -i macs /etc/ssh/sshd_config
MACs hmac-sha2-256,hmac-sha2-512

If any ciphers other than \"hmac-sha2-256\" or \"hmac-sha2-512\" are listed or the
retuned line is commented out, this is a finding."

for the \"MACs\" keyword and set its value to \"hmac-sha2-256\" and/or
\"hmac-sha2-512\" (this file may be named differently or be in a different location
if using a version of SSH that is provided by a third-party vendor):

MACs hmac-sha2-256,hmac-sha2-512

The SSH service must be restarted for changes to take effect."
