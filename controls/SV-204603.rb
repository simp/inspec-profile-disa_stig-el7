  title 'The Red Hat Enterprise Linux operating system must, for networked systems, synchronize clocks with a server
    that is synchronized to one of the redundant United States Naval Observatory (USNO) time servers, a time server

  desc 'Inaccurate time stamps make it more difficult to correlate events and can lead to an inaccurate analysis.
    Determining the correct time a particular event occurred on a system is critical when conducting forensic analysis
    and investigating system events. Sources outside the configured acceptable allowance (drift) may be inaccurate.
    Synchronizing internal information system clocks provides uniformity of time stamps for information systems with
    multiple system clocks and systems connected over a network.
    Organizations should consider endpoints that may not have regular access to the authoritative time server (e.g.,
    mobile, teleworking, and tactical endpoints).'
