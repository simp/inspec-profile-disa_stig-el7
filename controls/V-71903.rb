password must contain at least one upper-case character."
  desc  "
    Use of a complex password helps to increase the time and resources required to
compromise the password. Password complexity, or strength, is a measure of the
effectiveness of a password in resisting attempts at guessing and brute-force
attacks.

    Password complexity is one factor of several that determines how long it takes
to crack a password. The more complex the password, the greater the number of
possible combinations that need to be tested before the password is compromised.
