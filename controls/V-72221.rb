  title "A FIPS 140-2 approved cryptographic algorithm must be used for SSH
communications."
  desc  "
    Unapproved mechanisms that are used for authentication to the cryptographic
module are not verified and therefore cannot be relied upon to provide
confidentiality or integrity, and DoD data may be compromised.

    Operating systems utilizing encryption are required to use FIPS-compliant
mechanisms for authenticating to cryptographic modules.

    FIPS 140-2 is the current standard for validating that mechanisms used to
access cryptographic modules utilize authentication that meets DoD
requirements. This allows for Security Levels 1, 2, 3, or 4 for use on a
general purpose computing system.

Inspect the \"Ciphers\" configuration with the following command:
