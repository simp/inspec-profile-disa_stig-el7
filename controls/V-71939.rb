If no line, a commented line, or a line indicating the value \"no\" is returned, the
required value is set.

passwords, add or correct the following line in \"/etc/ssh/sshd_config\":

PermitEmptyPasswords no

The SSH service must be restarted for changes to take effect.  Any accounts with
empty passwords should be disabled immediately, and PAM configuration should prevent
users from being able to assign themselves empty passwords."
