    List all device files on the system that are incorrectly labeled with the following commands:
    Note: Device files are normally found under "/dev", but applications may place device files in other directories and
    may necessitate a search of the entire system.
    #find /dev -context *:device_t:* \( -type c -o -type b \) -printf "%p %Z\n"

    machine. They will not be owned by a user on the system and require the "device_t" label to operate. These device
    files are not a finding.
    If there is output from either of these commands, other than already noted, this is a finding.}
