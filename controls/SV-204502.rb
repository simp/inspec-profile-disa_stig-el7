    requirements or mission objectives. These unnecessary capabilities or services are often overlooked and therefore
    may remain unsecured. They increase the risk to the platform by providing additional attack vectors.
    Operating systems are capable of providing a wide variety of functions and services. Some of the functions and
    services, provided by default, may not be necessary to support essential organizational operations (e.g., key
    missions, functions).
    Examples of non-essential capabilities include, but are not limited to, games, software packages, tools, and
    demonstration software not related to requirements or providing a wide array of functionality not required for every
