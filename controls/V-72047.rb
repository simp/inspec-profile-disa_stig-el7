    If a world-writable directory has the sticky bit set and is not group-owned
by a privileged Group Identifier (GID), unauthorized users may be able to
modify files created by others.

    The only authorized public directories are those temporary directories
supplied with the system or those designed to be temporary file repositories.
The setting is normally reserved for directories used by the system and by
users for temporary file storage, (e.g., /tmp), and for directories requiring
global read/write access.
