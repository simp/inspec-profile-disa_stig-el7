  title "The operating system must uniquely identify and must authenticate
organizational users (or processes acting on behalf of organizational users) using
multifactor authentication."
  desc  "
    To assure accountability and prevent unauthenticated access, organizational
users must be identified and authenticated to prevent potential misuse and
compromise of the system.

    Organizational users include organizational employees or individuals the
organization deems to have equivalent status of employees (e.g., contractors).
Organizational users (and processes acting on behalf of users) must be uniquely
identified and authenticated to all accesses, except for the following:

    1) Accesses explicitly identified and documented by the organization.
Organizations document specific user actions that can be performed on the
information system without identification or authentication;

    and

    2) Accesses that occur through authorized use of group authenticators without
individual authentication. Organizations may require unique identification of
individuals in group accounts (e.g., shared privilege accounts) or for detailed
accountability of individual activity.
