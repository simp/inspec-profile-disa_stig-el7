    accidentally pressed, as could happen in the case of a mixed OS environment, this can create the risk of short-term
    loss of availability of systems due to unintentional reboot. In the GNOME graphical environment, risk of
    unintentional reboot from the Ctrl-Alt-Delete sequence is reduced because the user will be prompted before any
