lifetime."
  desc  "Enforcing a minimum password lifetime helps to prevent repeated
password changes to defeat the password reuse or history enforcement
requirement. If users are allowed to immediately and continually change their
password, the password could be repeatedly changed in a short period of time to
defeat the organization's policy regarding password reuse."
