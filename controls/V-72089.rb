Check the system configuration to determine the partition the audit records are

# grep log_file /etc/audit/auditd.conf

Check the size of the partition that audit records are written to (with the

If the audit records are not being written to a partition specifically created
for audit records (in this example \"/var/log/audit\" is a separate partition),
determine the amount of space other files in the partition are currently
occupying with the following command:

# du -sh <partition>

Determine what the threshold is for the system to take action when 75 percent
of the repository maximum audit record storage capacity is reached:

# grep -i space_left /etc/audit/auditd.conf
space_left = 225
