    A session time-out lock is a temporary action taken when a user stops work
and moves away from the immediate physical vicinity of the information system
but does not log out because of the temporary nature of the absence. Rather
than relying on the user to manually lock their operating system session prior
to vacating the vicinity, operating systems need to be able to identify when a
user's session has idled and take action to initiate the session lock.

    The session lock is implemented at the point where session activity can be
determined and/or controlled.

Check for the session idle delay setting with the following command:
