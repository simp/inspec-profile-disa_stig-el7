frequently."
  desc  "
    Virus scanning software can be used to protect a system from penetration
from computer viruses and to limit their spread through intermediate systems.

    The virus scanning software should be configured to check for software and
virus definition updates with a frequency no longer than seven days. If a
manual process is required to update the virus scan software or definitions, it
must be documented with the Information System Security Officer (ISSO).

Check for the presence of \"McAfee VirusScan Enterprise for Linux\" with the

the system with the following command:

systemctl status clamav-daemon.socket

If \"McAfee VirusScan Enterprise for Linux\" is active on the system, check the
dates of the virus definition files with the following command:

# ls -al /opt/NAI/LinuxShield/engine/dat/*.dat
<need output>

If the virus definition files have dates older than seven days from the current
date, this is a finding.

If \"clamav\" is active on the system, check the dates of the virus database
with the following commands:

# grep -I databasedirectory /etc/clamav.conf
DatabaseDirectory /var/lib/clamav

# ls -al /var/lib/clamav/*.cvd
-rwxr-xr-x  1 root root      149156 Mar  5  2011 daily.cvd

If the database file has a date older than seven days from the current date,
this is a finding."
