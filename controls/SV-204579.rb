  title 'The Red Hat Enterprise Linux operating system must be configured so that all network connections associated
    with a communication session are terminated at the end of the session or after 15 minutes of inactivity from the
    user at a command prompt, except to fulfill documented and validated mission requirements.'
  desc 'Terminating an idle session within a short time period reduces the window of opportunity for unauthorized
    personnel to take control of a management session enabled on the console or console port that has been left
    unattended. In addition, quickly terminating an idle session will also free up resources committed by the managed
    network element.
    Terminating network connections associated with communications sessions includes, for example, de-allocating
    associated TCP/IP address/port pairs at the operating system level and de-allocating networking assignments at the
    application level if multiple application sessions are using a single operating system-level network connection.
    This does not mean that the operating system terminates all sessions or network access; it only ends the inactive
    session and releases the resources associated with that session.'
