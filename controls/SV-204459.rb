  desc 'Timely patching is critical for maintaining the operational availability, confidentiality, and integrity of
    information technology (IT) systems. However, failure to keep operating system and application software patched is a
    common mistake made by IT professionals. New patches are released daily, and it is often difficult for even
    experienced System Administrators to keep abreast of all the new patches. When new weaknesses in an operating system
    exist, patches are usually made available by the vendor to resolve the problems. If the most recent security patches
    and updates are not installed, unauthorized users may take advantage of weaknesses in the unpatched software. The
    lack of prompt attention to patching could result in a system compromise.'

  desc 'check', "Verify the operating system security patches and updates are installed and
      up to date. Updates are required to be applied with a frequency determined by
      the site or Program Management Office (PMO).

      Obtain the list of available package security updates from Red Hat. The URL
      for updates is https://rhn.redhat.com/errata/. It is important to note that
      updates provided by Red Hat may not be present on the system if the underlying
      packages are not installed.

      Check that the available package security updates have been installed on
      the system with the following command:

          # yum history list | more
          Loaded plugins: langpacks, product-id, subscription-manager

          If package updates have not been performed on the system within the
      timeframe that the site/program documentation requires, this is a finding.

    If the operating system is in non-compliance with the Information Assurance
Vulnerability Management (IAVM) process, this is a finding.
