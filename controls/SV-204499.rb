    Check to see if Advanced Intrusion Detection Environment (AIDE) is installed on the system with the following
    command:
    # yum list installed aide
    If AIDE is not installed, ask the System Administrator how file integrity checks are performed on the system.
    If there is no application installed to perform file integrity checks, this is a finding.
    Note: AIDE is highly configurable at install time. These commands assume the "aide.conf" file is under the "/etc"
    directory.
    Use the following command to determine if the file is in another location:
    # find / -name aide.conf
    Check the "aide.conf" file to determine if the "xattrs" rule has been added to the rule list being applied to the
    files and directories selection lists.
    An example rule that includes the "xattrs" rule follows:
    All= p+i+n+u+g+s+m+S+sha512+acl+xattrs+selinux
    /bin All # apply the custom rule to the files in bin
    /sbin All # apply the same custom rule to the files in sbin
    If the "xattrs" rule is not being used on all uncommented selection lines in the "/etc/aide.conf" file, or extended
    attributes are not being checked by another file integrity tool, this is a finding.'
