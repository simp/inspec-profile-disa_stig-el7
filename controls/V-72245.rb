this is a finding."

last occurred by setting the required configuration options in \"/etc/pam.d/sshd\"

used in the example) (this file may be named differently or be in a different
location if using a version of SSH that is provided by a third-party vendor).

Add the following line to the top of \"/etc/pam.d/sshd\":

session     required      pam_lastlog.so showfailed

Or modify the \"PrintLastLog\" line in \"/etc/ssh/sshd_config\" to match the
following:

PrintLastLog yes

The SSH service must be restarted for changes to \"sshd_config\" to take effect."
