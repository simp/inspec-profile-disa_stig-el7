    Without protection of the transmitted information, confidentiality and integrity
may be compromised because unprotected communications can be intercepted and either
read or altered.

    This requirement applies to both internal and external networks and all types of
information system components from which information can be transmitted (e.g.,
servers, mobile devices, notebook computers, printers, copiers, scanners, and
facsimile machines). Communication paths outside the physical protection of a
controlled boundary are exposed to the possibility of interception and modification.

    Protecting the confidentiality and integrity of organizational information can
be accomplished by physical means (e.g., employing physical distribution systems) or
by logical means (e.g., employing cryptographic techniques). If physical means of
protection are employed, logical means (cryptography) do not have to be employed,
and vice versa.
