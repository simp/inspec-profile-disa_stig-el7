List all device files on the system that are incorrectly labeled with the

Note: Device files are normally found under \"/dev\", but applications may
place device files in other directories and may necessitate a search of the
entire system.

#find /dev -context *:device_t:* \\( -type c -o -type b \\) -printf \"%p %Z\n\"

#find /dev -context *:unlabeled_t:* \\( -type c -o -type b \\) -printf \"%p %Z\n

Note: There are device files, such as \"/dev/vmci\", that are used when the
operating system is a host virtual machine. They will not be owned by a user on
the system and require the \"device_t\" label to operate. These device files
are not a finding.

If there is output from either of these commands, other than already noted,
this is a finding."

command:
