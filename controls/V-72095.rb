  desc  "Misuse of privileged functions, either intentionally or
unintentionally by authorized users, or by unauthorized external entities that
have compromised information system accounts, is a serious and ongoing concern
and can have significant adverse impacts on organizations. Auditing the use of
privileged functions is one way to detect such misuse and identify the risk
from insider threats and the advanced persistent threat."
