    It is critical for the appropriate personnel to be aware if a system is at
risk of failing to process audit logs as required. Without this notification,
the security personnel may be unaware of an impending failure of the audit
capability, and system operation may be adversely affected.

    Audit processing failures include software/hardware errors, failures in the
audit capturing mechanisms, and audit storage capacity being reached or
exceeded.

    This requirement applies to each audit data storage repository (i.e.,
distinct information system component where audit records are stored), the
centralized audit storage capacity of organizations (i.e., all audit data
storage repositories combined), or both.

Check to see what level \"auditctl\" is set to with following command:

If the value of \"failure\" is set to \"2\", the system is configured to panic
(shut down) in the event of an auditing failure.

If the value of \"failure\" is set to \"1\", the system is configured to only
send information to the kernel log regarding the failure.

If the \"failure\" setting is not set, this is a CAT I finding.

If the \"failure\" setting is set to any value other than \"1\" or \"2\", this
is a CAT II finding.

If the \"failure\" setting is set to \"1\" but the availability concern is not
documented or there is no monitoring of the kernel log, this is a CAT III
finding.
