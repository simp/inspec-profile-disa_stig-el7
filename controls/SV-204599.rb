  title 'The Red Hat Enterprise Linux operating system must be configured so that the SSH daemon does not permit
    Kerberos authentication unless needed.'
  desc "Kerberos authentication for SSH is often implemented using Generic Security Service Application Program
    Interface (GSSAPI). If Kerberos is enabled through SSH, the SSH daemon provides a means of access to the system's
    Kerberos implementation. Vulnerabilities in the system's Kerberos implementation may then be subject to
    exploitation. To reduce the attack surface of the system, the Kerberos authentication mechanism within SSH must be
    disabled for systems not using this capability."
