  title 'The Red Hat Enterprise Linux operating system must be configured so that all networked systems use SSH for
    confidentiality and integrity of transmitted and received information as well as information during preparation for
    transmission.'
  desc 'Without protection of the transmitted information, confidentiality and integrity may be compromised because
    unprotected communications can be intercepted and either read or altered.
    This requirement applies to both internal and external networks and all types of information system components from
    which information can be transmitted (e.g., servers, mobile devices, notebook computers, printers, copiers,
    scanners, and facsimile machines). Communication paths outside the physical protection of a controlled boundary are
    exposed to the possibility of interception and modification.
    Protecting the confidentiality and integrity of organizational information can be accomplished by physical means
    (e.g., employing physical distribution systems) or by logical means (e.g., employing cryptographic techniques). If
    physical means of protection are employed, then logical means (cryptography) do not have to be employed, and vice
    versa.'
