    Password complexity, or strength, is a measure of the effectiveness of a password in resisting attempts at guessing
    and brute-force attacks.
    Password complexity is one factor of several that determines how long it takes to crack a password. The more complex
    the password, the greater the number of possible combinations that need to be tested before the password is
