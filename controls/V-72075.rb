removable media.

Note: GRUB 2 reads its configuration from the \"/boot/grub2/grub.cfg\" file on
traditional BIOS-based machines and from the \"/boot/efi/EFI/redhat/grub.cfg\"
file on UEFI machines.

Check for the existence of alternate boot loader configuration files with the
following command:

# find / -name grub.cfg
/boot/grub2/grub.cfg

If a \"grub.cfg\" is found in any subdirectories other than \"/boot/grub2\" and
\"/boot/efi/EFI/redhat\", ask the System Administrator if there is
documentation signed by the ISSO to approve the use of removable media as a
boot loader.

Check that the grub configuration file has the set root command in each menu
entry with the following commands:

# grep -c menuentry /boot/grub2/grub.cfg
1
# grep ‘set root’ /boot/grub2/grub.cfg
set root=(hd0,1)

If the system is using an alternate boot loader on removable media, and
documentation does not exist approving the alternate configuration, this is a
finding."
