creations, modifications, disabling, and termination events that affect
/etc/passwd."
  desc  "
    Without generating audit records that are specific to the security and
mission needs of the organization, it would be difficult to establish,
correlate, and investigate the events relating to an incident or identify those
responsible for one.

    Audit records can be generated from various components within the
information system (e.g., module or policy filter).
