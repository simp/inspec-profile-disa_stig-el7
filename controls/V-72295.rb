  title "Network interfaces must not be in promiscuous mode."
  desc  "
    Network interfaces in promiscuous mode allow for the capture of all network
traffic visible to the system. If unauthorized individuals can access these
applications, it may allow then to collect information such as logon IDs,
passwords, and key exchanges between systems.

    If the system is being used to perform a network troubleshooting function,
the use of these tools must be documented with the Information System Security
Officer (ISSO) and restricted to only authorized personnel.
