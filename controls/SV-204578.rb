  desc 'Unapproved mechanisms that are used for authentication to the cryptographic module are not verified and
    therefore cannot be relied upon to provide confidentiality or integrity, and DoD data may be compromised.
    Operating systems utilizing encryption are required to use FIPS-compliant mechanisms for authenticating to
    cryptographic modules.
    FIPS 140-2 is the current standard for validating that mechanisms used to access cryptographic modules utilize
    authentication that meets DoD requirements. This allows for Security Levels 1, 2, 3, or 4 for use on a general
    purpose computing system.
    The system will attempt to use the first cipher presented by the client that matches the server list. Listing the
    values "strongest to weakest" is a method to ensure the use of the strongest cipher available to secure the SSH
    connection.'
