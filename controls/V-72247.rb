access via SSH."

layer of security is gained by extending the policy of not logging on directly as
root. In addition, logging on with a user-specific account provides individual
accountability of actions performed on the system."

out, this is a finding."

differently or be in a different location if using a version of SSH that is provided
by a third-party vendor):

PermitRootLogin no

The SSH service must be restarted for changes to take effect."
