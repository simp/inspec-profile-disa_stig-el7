    To assure accountability and prevent unauthenticated access, users must be
identified and authenticated to prevent potential misuse and compromise of the
system.

    Multifactor solutions that require devices separate from information
systems gaining access include, for example, hardware tokens providing
time-based or challenge-response authenticators and smart cards such as the
U.S. Government Personal Identity Verification card and the DoD Common Access
Card.
