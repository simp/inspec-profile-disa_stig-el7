  desc  "
    Preventing non-privileged users from executing privileged functions
mitigates the risk that unauthorized individuals or processes may gain
unnecessary access to information or privileges.

    Privileged functions include, for example, establishing accounts,
performing system integrity checks, or administering cryptographic key
management activities. Non-privileged users are individuals who do not possess
appropriate authorizations. Circumventing intrusion detection and prevention
mechanisms or malicious code protection mechanisms are examples of privileged
functions that require protection from non-privileged users.

Get a list of authorized users (other than System Administrator and guest

Check the list against the system by using the following command:

# semanage login -l | more
Login Name  SELinux User   MLS/MCS Range  Service
__default__  user_u    s0-s0:c0.c1023   *
root   unconfined_u   s0-s0:c0.c1023   *
system_u  system_u   s0-s0:c0.c1023   *
joe  staff_u   s0-s0:c0.c1023   *

All administrators must be mapped to the \"sysadm_u\" or \"staff_u\" users with
the appropriate domains (sysadm_t and staff_t).

All authorized non-administrative users must be mapped to the \"user_u\" role
or the appropriate domain (user_t).

If they are not mapped in this way, this is a finding."
