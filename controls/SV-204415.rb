    The strength of encryption that must be used to hash passwords for all accounts is SHA512.
    Check that the system is configured to create SHA512 hashed passwords with the following command:
    # grep password /etc/pam.d/system-auth /etc/pam.d/password-auth
    Outcome should look like following:
    /etc/pam.d/system-auth-ac:password    sufficient    pam_unix.so sha512 shadow try_first_pass use_authtok
    /etc/pam.d/password-auth:password    sufficient    pam_unix.so sha512 shadow try_first_pass use_authtok

    than SHA512 to be used, this is a finding.'
