  tag "check": "If the \"firewalld\" package is not installed, ask the System
Administrator (SA) if another firewall application (such as iptables) is installed.
If an application firewall is not installed, this is a finding.

Verify the system's access control program is configured to grant or deny system
access to specific hosts.

Check to see if \"firewalld\" is active with the following command:

# systemctl status firewalld
firewalld.service - firewalld - dynamic firewall daemon
   Loaded: loaded (/usr/lib/systemd/system/firewalld.service; enabled)
   Active: active (running) since Sun 2014-04-20 14:06:46 BST; 30s ago

If \"firewalld\" is active, check to see if it is configured to grant or deny access
to specific hosts or services with the following commands:

# firewall-cmd --get-default-zone
public

# firewall-cmd --list-all --zone=public
public (default, active)
  interfaces: eth0
  sources:
  services: mdns ssh
  ports:
  masquerade: no
  forward-ports:
  icmp-blocks:
  rich rules:
 rule family=\"ipv4\" source address=\"92.188.21.1/24\" accept
 rule family=\"ipv4\" source address=\"211.17.142.46/32\" accept

If \"firewalld\" is not active, determine whether \"tcpwrappers\" is being used by
checking whether the \"hosts.allow\" and \"hosts.deny\" files are empty with the
following commands:

# ls -al /etc/hosts.allow
rw-r----- 1 root root 9 Aug  2 23:13 /etc/hosts.allow

# ls -al /etc/hosts.deny
-rw-r----- 1 root root  9 Apr  9  2007 /etc/hosts.deny

If \"firewalld\" and \"tcpwrappers\" are not installed, configured, and active, ask
the SA if another access control program (such as iptables) is installed and active.
Ask the SA to show that the running configuration grants or denies access to
specific hosts or services.

If \"firewalld\" is active and is not configured to grant access to specific hosts
and \"tcpwrappers\" is not configured to grant or deny access to specific hosts,
this is a finding."
  tag "fix": "If \"firewalld\" is installed and active on the system, configure
rules for allowing specific services and hosts.

If \"tcpwrappers\" is installed, configure the \"/etc/hosts.allow\" and
\"/etc/hosts.deny\" to allow or deny access to specific hosts."
