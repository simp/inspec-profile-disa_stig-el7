    It is detrimental for operating systems to provide, or install by default,
functionality exceeding requirements or mission objectives. These unnecessary
capabilities or services are often overlooked and therefore may remain
unsecured. They increase the risk to the platform by providing additional
attack vectors.

    Operating systems are capable of providing a wide variety of functions and
services. Some of the functions and services, provided by default, may not be
necessary to support essential organizational operations (e.g., key missions,
functions).

    Examples of non-essential capabilities include, but are not limited to,
games, software packages, tools, and demonstration software not related to
requirements or providing a wide array of functionality not required for every
mission, but which cannot be disabled.
