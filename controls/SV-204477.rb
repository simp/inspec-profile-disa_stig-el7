  desc "The executable search path (typically the PATH environment variable) contains a list of directories for the
    shell to search to find executables. If this path includes the current working directory (other than the user's home
    directory), executables in these directories may be executed instead of system commands. This variable is formatted
    as a colon-separated list of directories. If there is an empty entry, such as a leading or trailing colon or two
    consecutive colons, this is interpreted as the current working directory. If deviations from the default system
    search path for the local interactive user are required, they must be documented with the Information System
    Security Officer (ISSO)."
