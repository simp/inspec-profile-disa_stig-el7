  desc  "Password complexity, or strength, is a measure of the effectiveness of a
password in resisting attempts at guessing and brute-force attacks. If the
information system or application allows the user to consecutively reuse their
password when that password has exceeded its defined lifetime, the end result is a
password that is not changed per policy requirements."
