    Note: A file integrity tool other than Advanced Intrusion Detection Environment (AIDE) may be used, but the tool
    must be executed and notify specified individuals via email or an alert.
    Check to see if AIDE is installed on the system with the following command:
    # yum list installed aide
    If AIDE is not installed, ask the SA how file integrity checks are performed on the system.
    Check for the presence of a cron job running routinely on the system that executes AIDE to scan for changes to the
    system baseline. The commands used in the example will use a daily occurrence.
    Check the cron directories for a "crontab" script file controlling the execution of the file integrity application.
    For example, if AIDE is installed on the system, use the following command:
    # ls -al /etc/cron.* | grep aide
    -rwxr-xr-x 1 root root 32 Jul 1 2011 aide
    # grep aide /etc/crontab /var/spool/cron/root
    /etc/crontab: 30 04 * * * root /usr/sbin/aide  --check
    /var/spool/cron/root: 30 04 * * * /usr/sbin/aide  --check
    AIDE does not have a configuration that will send a notification, so the cron job uses the mail application on the
    system to email the results of the file integrity run as in the following example:
    # more /etc/cron.daily/aide
    #!/bin/bash
    /usr/sbin/aide --check | /bin/mail -s "$HOSTNAME - Daily aide integrity check run" root@sysname.mil
    If the file integrity application does not notify designated personnel of changes, this is a finding.'
  desc 'fix', 'Configure the operating system to notify designated personnel if baseline configurations are changed
    in an unauthorized manner. The AIDE tool can be configured to email designated personnel with the use of the cron
    system.
    The following example output is generic. It will set cron to run AIDE daily and to send email at the completion of
    the analysis.
    # more /etc/cron.daily/aide
    /usr/sbin/aide --check | /bin/mail -s "$HOSTNAME - Daily aide integrity check run" root@sysname.mil'
