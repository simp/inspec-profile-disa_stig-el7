# EL7 DISA STIG InSpec Profile Maintained by the SIMP Project

This [InSpec](https://github.com/chef/inspec) profile is being developed and
maintained as part of the SIMP project.

That said, it is our goal to make them valid for general purpose usage and
hopefully hand them off to a more structured body as time progresses.

# Testing

This repository uses either [Beaker](https://github.com/puppetlabs/beaker) to
run tests or the [KitchenCI](http://kitchen.ci) framework to run tests on the
various profiles. Please see the documentation below on how to use each of the
frameworks.

# Testing with Beaker

To run the tests, perform the following actions:

1. Have Ruby 2.3.0 or later installed
2. Run ``bundle install``
3. Run ``rake beaker:suites``

### Debugging

If you need to debug your systems, you can run Beaker with a couple of options:

1. Preserve the VM unconditionally
   * ``BEAKER_destroy=no rake beaker:suites``

2. Preserve the VM unless the tests pass
   * ``BEAKER_destroy=onpass rake beaker:suites``

You can then access the VM by going to the root level of the repository and
navigating to `.vagrant/beaker_vagrant_files/<automatic directory>`.

You should find a `Vagrantfile` at that location and can use any standard
[Vagrant CLI Commands](https://www.vagrantup.com/docs/cli/).

The most useful of these will be ``vagrant status`` and ``vagrant ssh <vm name>``.

## Test Layout

The tests are housed under the ``spec/acceptance`` directory and use the
profiles in ``spec/fixtures/inspec_profiles`` during testing.

# Testing with Kitchen

## Dependencies

* Ruby 2.3.0 or later
* [Virtualbox](https://www.virtualbox.org)
* [Vagrant](https://www.vagrantup.com)

#### _Notes to Windows Users_

1. An installation of ChefDK may generate conflicts when combined with the
   installed kitchen gems. **Recommend NOT installing ChefDK before testing
   with this repo.**

2. If you run into errors when running ``bundle install``, use the following
   commands to install gems:
  * ``gem install kitchen-puppet``
  * ``gem install librarian-puppet``
  * ``gem install kitchen-vagrant``

3. If the tests are not found when running ``kitchen verify``, open
   ``.kitchen.yml`` and consult ``inspec_tests`` under the ``suites`` section.

4. You may also experience an error when running ``kitchen converge`` where a
   folder is unable to be created due to the length of the path. In this case,
   you may need to edit a registry key as explained
   [here](https://www.howtogeek.com/266621/how-to-make-windows-10-accept-file-paths-over-260-characters/).

## Setting up your box

1. Clone the repo via `git clone -b dev https://github.com/simp/inspec_profiles.git`
2. cd to `inspec_profiles`
3. Run ``bundle install``
4. Run `kitchen list` - you should see the following choice:
   * `default-centos-7`
5. Run `kitchen converge default-centos-7`
6. Run `kitchen list` - your should see your host with status "converged"

## Validating your box

**Note:** Once the open issues are resolved in InSpec and kitchen-inspec these
steps will not really be needed but for now we have to do a few things a bit
more manually. Once resolved fully, you will only need to run `kitchen verify
(machine name)` and everything will be taken care of.

### In the 'inspec_profiles' dir ( manually )

1. cd `.kitchen/`
2. vi default-centos-7.yml
3. copy the `ssh_key:` value for later
4. note the mapped port value ( usually `2222`) and use in the next steps

### In the 'inspec_profiles' dir

1. On the terminal: `export SSH_KEY=(value from before)`
2. cd to `inspec_profiles`
   * (optional) run an `inspec check`, and
   ensure there are no errors in the baseline.

3. run: `inspec exec -i $SSH_KEY -t
   ssh://vagrant@127.0.0.1:2222 ( or the port mapped from step '4' above )`
   * (optional) `inspec exec controls/V-#####
   * -i $SSH_KEY -t
   ssh://vagrant@127.0.0.1:2222` to just test a single control
   * (optional) `inspec exec -i $SSH_KEY
   --controls=V-#####,V-##### -t ssh://vagrant@127.0.0.1:2222` to just test a
   small set of controls

# Hardening Development

If you are going to be working on the ansible scripts you can continue to run
`kitchen converge` and it will rerun your ansible scripts without going through
the entire machine creations process etc.

  * Making Changes and Testing
    - run `kitchen converge (machine name)` - runs any changes to your hardening scripts
    - run `kitchen verify (machine name)` - runs the inspec tests

  * Starting Clean:
    - run `kitchen destroy (machine name)` kitchen will drop your box and you can start clean
  * Going through the entire process ( create, build, configure, verify, destroy )
    - run `kitchen test (machine name)` or to test all defined machines `kitchen test`
  * Just running the validation scripts
    - run `kitchen verify (machine name)`
  * just run one or more controls in the validation
    - edit the .kitchen.yml file in the `controls:` section add the `control id(s)` to the list

## Saving your output

### Regular Text File
  * To save your output just use `> output.txt`

### Save as HTML

In the `tools` directory there are a few useful scripts for getting a little
better output for general display and demo, to use them see the `README.md`
file in the `tools` directory or as an example:

  * `kitchen converge (machine name) | ./tools/ansi2html.sh --bg=dark > kitchen-run.html`
  * `inspec exec . -i $SSH_KEY -t ssh://vagrant@127.0.0.1:2222 | ./tools/ansi2html.sh --bg=dark > inspec-validation-run.html`
